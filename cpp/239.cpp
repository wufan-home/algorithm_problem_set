/*
    Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

    For example,
    Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.

    Window position                Max
    ---------------               -----
    [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
     1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
     1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
     1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
     1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
     1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
    Therefore, return the max sliding window as [3,3,5,5,6,7].

    Note: 
    You may assume k is always valid, ie: 1 ≤ k ≤ input array's size for non-empty array.

    Follow up:
    Could you solve it in linear time?
    
    Solution: This solution is very smart. Use a dequeue. The first is always the maxium of a window.
    Every time when a new element comes in, we have two cases need to handle:
    1. The size of the dequeue has k elements already. (Pop the front.)
    2. Compare every elements of the dequeue from the back, pop back all elements that are smaller than
    the new one.
    3. The contents of the dequeue should be the indices of the elements, but not the value.

        }
        return res;
