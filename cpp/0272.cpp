/*
    Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, 
    find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

    Note:
    Given target value is a floating point.
    You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
    You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
    Follow up:
    Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?
