/*
    Give an sequence of integers. If there are three or more consecutive same elements in it, remove all of them from the sequence. 
    
    Repeat this action until there are no such segments found. Print the final form of the sequence.

    Eg. [1] -> [1]
    Eg. [1,2] -> [1,2]
    Eg. [1,1] -> [1,1]
    Eg. [1,1,1] -> []
    Eg. [1,2,2,2,1] -> [1,1]
    Eg. [1,1,2,2,2,1] -> []

    Assume: 1 <= sequence size <= 10000.
