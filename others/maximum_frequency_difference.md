# Find the maximum deviation from all substrings

The *deviation* is defined by the maximum frequency of characters and the minimum frequency of characters in a string. The question is to find the *maximum deviation* of a string. The *maximum deviation* is defined as the maximum deviation of all substrings of a string. For example, the deviation of the string is `abbba` is 2. The substring `abbb` or `bbba` are the candidates which provide the deviation.

## Solution

Use the *voting algorithm*. The question can be viewed as a campain for two candidates, i.e., two characters.

## Code

```cpp
